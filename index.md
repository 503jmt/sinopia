This is the landing page for technical information about Sinopia, a project to build an RDF-native descriptive cataloging system. Here you will find information on [the scope of this effort](mvp.html); a [proposed, conceptual architecture for this MVP](architecture.html); and the [implementation selections made for development and deploying this architecture](implementation.html). You might also check out our [influences page](influences.html), which lists projects, technologies, and codebases that guided our Sinopia technology in some way.

This work is part of the Linked Data for Libraries series of projects. For more information on the most recent iteration of this project - LD4P2 - check out https://wiki.duraspace.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=101783799.
